> This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial. In this video, we're going to build a Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI. Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. It allows you to control absolutely everything in the app using your voice. Another huge benefit is that it's extremely easy to integrate it. We'll do it together in this video and afterward, you'll be able to create your own voice-controlled apps.



## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
npm install
```
This Command will install all dependencies for this project.

## Developing

### Built With
1. Html
2. Css
3. Material-UI
4. React
5. React-Icon
6. Alan-AI Voice Assistant


### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
1. Node
2. Npm


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone [Voice-assistant-react-app-with-alan-ai.git](https://github.com/MRJAHID/Voice-assistant-react-app-with-alan-ai.git)
cd your-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
This project is deployed by Firebase Console
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

<!-- We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags). -->
Alan-ai 1.00 Â© 2022
